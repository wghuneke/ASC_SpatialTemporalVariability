# ASC_SpatialTemporalVariability

A project to analyse the spatial and temporal variability of the Antarctic Slope Front in ACCESS-OM2-01 in a simulation with repeat year forcing (1990/91).

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that reproduce the analyses and figures included in the paper:

Huneke W. G. H., Morrison A. K., Hogg A. McC. (2022) Spatial and subannual variability of the Antarctic Slope Current in an eddying ocean-sea ice model. *Journal of Physical Oceanography*, volume, number, pages, doi:10.1175/JPO-D-21-0143.1
